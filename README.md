## The app

**MultiLanguage** site, Its contain two languages, English and Danish. 
I am handling multi language from jquery. I have created langauge.js for this purpose. The onclick function is called when the user hit change language and then using jquery I just replace the text.

**Form**. All the validation is carried out in client side.
After you submit a form Data goes to DB and also email to pre define email address

**Responsiveness**. For a Responsive website, I used New Framework MaterilizeCss which is from Google.
